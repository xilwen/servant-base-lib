# SERVANT Base Library
SERVANT is a assistant program to let you install and manage virtualized Linux server on Windows easily.   
You can get servers from SERVANT's online services, download, install and run it in SERVANT Manager. Servers are packaged as a virtual machine.  
SERVANT uses Virtualbox for VM management.
